RustyRakoon
===========

[Arakoon](http://www.arakoon.org) client library written in Rust, mainly started as an exercise to learn the language and still in a very embryonic state that so far consists of an incomplete low level interface in the `bits` module.
A more convenient, asynchronous interface is intended to be built on top of it.

Documentation
-------------

To be written. For the time being [tests/basics.rs](tests/basics.rs) demonstrates the usage of the low level interface.
